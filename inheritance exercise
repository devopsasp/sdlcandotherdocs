   Exercise for Inheritance 

 1.View the below class 
 
   public class Animal 
  {
     public String animalName;
      public String animalType; 
 } 

 #create two class Carnivourous and Herbivorous by inheriting Animal class 
 #create functions in both the class to display animal Name and animal Type 

2.Case Study 

   Jennifer has been given a task to create a base class Vehicle with attributes vehicleNumber ,vehicleName
   She has to also create sub type of this class 
   The heirarchy is like below 
 
                                         Vehicle 
                                             |

                                 |                             |
                           TwoWheeler                         FourWheeler
                               |                                   |

   #Create a function a vehicle class to display vehicle details like vehiclename and vehicleNumber
   #The subclasses should have a function to accept parameters like for vehiclename and vehiclenumber 
    #Create object of each subclass and call in main method of a class named VehicleApp
